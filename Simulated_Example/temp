NOTES ON VARIOGRAM CALCULATION:
1) By default, varcalc runs checks for common errors in parameter choices. This can be
disabled if desired. 
2) Varcalc can standardize using a provided sill (such as a declustered variance).
For example, if variable 1 has a declustered variance of 8.6, the traditional
semivariogram could be standardized by setting the variogram type to:
1  1  1  8.6
Alternatively, varcalc can attempt to infer a sill for standardizing by setting
the variogram type to:
1  1  1  ?
The calculated sills will be written to the console. 
3) Variogram types are the same as in GSLIB:
1 = traditional semivariogram
2 = traditional cross semivariogram
3 = covariance   (-3 calculates variance (provided sill) -covariance)
4 = correlogram  (-4 calculates 1-correlation)
5 = general relative semivariogram
6 = pairwise relative semivariogram
7 = semivariogram of logarithms
8 = semimadogram
9 = indicator semivariogram - continuous  - requires a cutoff
10= indicator semivariogram - categorical - requires a category
4) For indicator variograms, the variogram cutoff/categories are specified immediately after the variogram type
1   1   9   1.0   ?               -tail variable, head variable, variogram type (and cutoff/category), sill
5) If desired, the program can write out the variogram points in the gamv2004 style
for compatibility with older versions. Tilt was not supported in pre-varcalc experimental variogram
programs so use carefully.
